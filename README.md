# Tic Tac Toe Robot
Developed a Tic Tac Toe robot using Lego EV3 and C, automating gameplay through sensor integration and algorithmic decision-making.

Introduing a Tic Tac Toe robot capable of playing against a human by optimizing both mechanical and software design for efficiency. The robot interprets player moves, manages piece storage, tracks the game board in memory, places pieces accurately, and determines game outcomes—win, lose, or draw—using custom algorithms. The game is built using a Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to ensure a tie or a win every time a user plays.
